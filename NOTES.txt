WHAT CAN i DO
analysis of the needs
the requirement can initially be in any shape, I'll produce in the end something understandable
-> AGILE organisation: using JIRA

then
--------------------------------
-> development proposal
OR -----------------------------
-> writing requirements
-> architecture proposal
 -> architecture agreement
--------------------------------

then
-> model development
   it can be independent parts, based on unitary tests
   it can be an "alpha" version, which means for example a fully operational model with hardcoded inputs which have been already unitary tested
 -> with continuous integration
   it means that I follow a plan which have been agreed before during development proposal
-> fully operational implementation
 -> with unit tests
   every important low-level mechanism is 
 -> with integration tests
 -> with continuous integration
-> software delivery
  any need/requirement will be officially tested and validated
